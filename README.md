# WorkDone
#The pandemic has been harsh to many of the people, and among the people who have seen the worst of it, were the daily wage workers who not only have to protect themselves from the virus but are also struggling to save their jobs. This idea would be useful not only to the workers, but also the common people like us who need their assist. This article addresses the idea that can be implemented to provide a web platform for the daily wage workers to find a job that could be either temporary or permanent based on the preference of the employee and the employer. The workers in search of daily usage would be reporting every day to the officers and would be waiting for these notifications to be posted and block notifications of their choice. This website will reduce the problem of the workers to go in search of a job in the crowds which could increase the risk of coming in contact with the virus. People can find their respective jobs just by sitting at their homes conveniently.
